# ASPNETMVCHowToImplementRoleBasedAuthorization

In this project, we will implement Identity service in ASP.NET MVC application using framework 6.0. We will secure our application data by providing complete login and user registration functionality using the Identity service provided by Microsoft. Identity service also provides lots of other functionality that enable developers to save time on coding for complete user management module. It include services like User Registration, Login, Log-out, Roles, Claims, Generating Token, User confirmation, Sending Email etc. We will cover the first aspect of security i.e.  user registration, login and log-out.
